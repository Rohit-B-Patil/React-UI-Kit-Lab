# ‚öõÔ∏è React UI Kit Lab (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

A lightweight, modular React project that includes essential UI components like **Dropdown**, **Accordion**, **Button**, and now a **fully sortable Table**, all styled using **TailwindCSS**. This UI kit is built to be reusable and extendable for real-world frontend projects.

Phase 2 introduces more advanced patterns like **custom navigation**, **modals with React Portals**, and a sortable **Table** with clean UX.
